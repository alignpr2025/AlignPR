Then, it attempts to retrieve longer candidate sequences by searching a local `cache_sequences` and then parallel searching external `datastores`. If no sequences are retrieved, it falls back to a default token. Finally, it processes the retrieved tokens, combines them with the initial candidate, and formats them into `cart_candidates` and `tree_candidates` to be used in the subsequent verification step."
