The class provides mechanisms to maintain a growing cache of keys and values, with methods like 'copy' to copy cached values at specified indices and 'cat' to concatenate new tensors with cached data. The initialize_past_key_values function sets up the caching infrastructure for storing past key-value states across all model layers, which is essential for efficient autoregressive decoding by reusing previously computed states."
how do they evaluate the best candidate depending on the prevoious states?,ase2025/FastCoder-main,ase2025/2502.17139v2.pdf,ase2025/FastCoder-main/fastcoder/model/utils.py,ase2025/FastCoder-main/fastcoder/model/utils.py,14,73,"The evaluate_posterior_using_cache function evaluates candidates based on previous states (logits from prior model outputs).

This directly answers how the best candidate is chosen depending on previous states."
how do they generate the candidates for the outputs?,ase2025/FastCoder-main,ase2025/2502.17139v2.pdf,ase2025/FastCoder-main/fastcoder/model/utils.py,ase2025/FastCoder-main/fastcoder/model/utils.py,73,119,"This code section shows how candidates are generated for outputs. The retrieve_from_cache function searches through cache_sequences to find matches with the current token sequence (this_token). When matches are found, it extracts the next_tokens following the matched sequence and collects them in matched_sequences. These matched sequences are then processed by process_results to create padded_paths, draft_attn_mask, tree_indices, draft_position_ids, and retrieve_indices - which are the candidate generation outputs. If no matches are found, empty lists are returned. This is the core candidate generation mechanism from the cache."
